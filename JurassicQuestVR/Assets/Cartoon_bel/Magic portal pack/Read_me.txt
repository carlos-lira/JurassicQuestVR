Dear developer! Thank you for your interest in my project. So, you have purchased a set, in which there are portals of different formats: sci-fi, stone, metal. The pack includes 11 portals (9 models and 11 effects). Each model has a scan and three textures - AlbedoTransparency, MetallicSmoothness and Default_Normal.
To use them you must export the pack with AssetStore, and it will appear in the "Project" tab. After that you can go to the Prefabs folder and drag the prefrag to the scene, then adjust its position, size and rotation.
To correctly display the glow of the particles, please use the following Bloom parameter settings:
The demo version includes a new unity after the effect from this page https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/51515
Just use the color post-effect on the camera.
THE NOTE! The camera must have an active HDR! (with direct rendering you need to disable anti-aliasing for proper HDR operation)
Settings for flowering
The threshold is 2
Soft knee - 0
The radius is 7
Intencity - 1
High quality is true
Anti Flicker is correct
The package works with a unit of 5.5+ with any rendering path, color space and api (DirectX 9/11/12, OpenGL, openGLES 2.0 / 3.0).

If you have any questions, please write to cartoon_bel@mail.ru.
Also, if you liked or did not like my project, you can leave a review about it and put it on AssetStore. I will be glad to have feedback from you.
